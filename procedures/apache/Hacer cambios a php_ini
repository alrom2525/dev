I've had the same problem with an earlier version of Ubuntu (12.04), Apache 2.2.22 and php5-fpm fastCGI flavour of PHP. Doing

	service apache2 restart 
isn't enough, because it just restarts the http server: you have to issue also the command

	service php5-fpm restart
to have the application server restarted and PHP read the php.ini file again.
