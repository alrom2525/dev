Solution
If you have checked that access for less secure apps is still enabled (Gmail turns it off if it is not being used), then you probably just need to clear Captcha: visit https://accounts.google.com/DisplayUnlockCaptcha and sign in with the username and password of the other account.

If necessary (it's usually not), enter the letters in the distorted picture then press Continue. This will allow ten minutes for Send Mail As to register as an approved connection.  NB: you must open this page using the credentials for the account you are using on the website - if the browser is already signed into another account, you must sign out first.  Also, you must trigger the website to make the connections within ten minutes of pressing Continue.
