agregar javascript a moodle
(todavia no lo he probado bien)
https://dzone.com/articles/adding-external-javascript-files-js-into-moodle

Steps
Go inside your “/theme/YourThemeName” folder. If you don’t have “javascript” folder inside “/theme/YourThemeName”, create a new folder called “javascript”.
Inside the new javascript folder that you have created, upload the .js files.
Next, go inside your “/theme/YourThemeName/config.php”. At the very bottom of the file, add a new line of code to include our javascript files.
#To load the js files in your header:
$THEME->javascripts = array(‘yourfirstjsfile’,’yoursecondjsfile’); 
#To load the js files in your footer:
$THEME->javascripts_footer = array(‘yourfirstjsfile’,’yoursecondjsfile’);


4. In order to see the changes, the caches of the site must be purged. Clear the browser cache and refresh to see the changes.




Otro:
In Moodle 2.0 this is used $PAGE->requires->js().

Make $PAGE available to your code by doing:

require_once($CFG->libdir . '/pagelib.php');
global $PAGE;
Add your code:

$PAGE->requires->js( new moodle_url($CFG->wwwroot . '/mod/mymod/script.js') );
It is required to put moodle_url() around your path!
