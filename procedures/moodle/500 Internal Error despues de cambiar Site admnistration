500 Internal Error after changing Site admnistration>>Development>>Debugging view all errors

In order to force the debugging messages to be off (so that you can revert to the previous state), try adding the following line to your config.php:

$CFG->debug=0;


Original question:
Hi Everybody,

We have a critical problem, I was trying to solve a problem in moodle. So i think that if i active error messages i can understand what should i do.

So i changed error shown type under "Site admnistration>>Development>>Debugging" to "All". After that i cant open moodle anymore. Displaying 500 Error. 

Please it is so critical for us.

Thank u.
