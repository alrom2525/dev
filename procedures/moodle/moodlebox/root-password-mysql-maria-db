You should not need to run mysql_secure_installation on a Raspberry Pi OS or Debian system. It is already set up to be secure.

From the README file (/usr/share/doc/mariadb-server-10.3/README.Debian.gz)

    * MARIADB IS SECURE BY DEFAULT
    ==============================

    MariaDB in Debian is secure by default, because:

    - It only listens to the localhost socket and cannot be accessed remotely unless the sysadmin changes the configurationin /etc/mysql to allow so.
    - There is no debian-sys-maint with password in /etc/mysql/debian.cnf anymore.
    - There is no root account with password anymore. The system admin needs to create one themselves if they need it. With no password, all issues related to password management and password leaking are gone. Sysadmins can access the database without a password simply by running 'sudo mysql' thanks to socket based authentication, which detects the system root user and allows them to use the mysqld console as the mysql root user. For details see https://www.slideshare.net/ottokekalain ... ening-tips
    - There is no test database nor test accounts in the out-of-the-box Debian installation.

    Therefore there is also no need to run the 'mysql_secure_installation'. In fact that script will try to do things that are already prevented, and might fail.
