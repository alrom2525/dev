Disable-the-application-App-Engine

App Engine offers no option to Undeploy an application. After an application is deployed, it remains deployed, although you could instead replace the application with a simple page that says something like "not in service."

However, you can disable the application, which causes it to no longer be accessible to users.

1. In the Cloud Console, on the Navigation menu (Navigation menu), click App Engine > Settings.

2. Click Disable application.

3. Read the dialog message. Enter the App ID and click DISABLE.

If you refresh the browser window you used to view to the application site, you'll get a 404 error.
