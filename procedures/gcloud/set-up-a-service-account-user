set-up-a-service-account-user

Assign narrow permissions to service accounts and learn how to use the Service Account User role.

Create a service account
	1. On the Navigation menu, click IAM & admin > Service accounts.
	2. Click Create service account.
	3. Specify the Service account name as read-bucket-objects .
	4. Click Create.
	5. Specify the Role as Cloud Storage > Storage Object Viewer .
	6. Click Continue.
	7. Click Done.

Add the user to the service account
	1. Select the read-bucket-objects service account.
	2. Click Add member in the Permissions panel. If you do not see the Permission panel, click on Show Info panel.
		You will grant the user the role of Service Account User, which allows that person to use a service account on a VM, if they have access to the VM.

		You could perform this activity for a specific user, group, or domain.

		For training purposes, you will grant the Service Account User role to everyone at a company called Altostrat.com. Altostrat.com is a fake company used for demonstration and training.

	3. Specify the following, and leave the remaining settings as their defaults:
		Property	Value (type value or select option as specified)
		New members	altostrat.com
		Select a role	Service Accounts > Service Account User
	4. Click Save.

Grant Compute Engine access
You now give the entire organization at Altostrat the Compute Engine Admin role.
	1. On the Navigation menu, click IAM & admin > IAM.
	2. Click Add.
	3. Specify the following, and leave the remaining settings as their defaults:
	Property	Value (type value or select option as specified)
	New members	altostrat.com
	Select a role	Compute Engine > Compute Instance Admin (v1)
	4. Click Save.
	This step is a rehearsal of the activity you would perform for a specific user.

	This action gives the user limited abilities with a VM instance. The user will be able to connect via SSH to a VM and perform some administration tasks.

Create a VM with the Service Account User
	1. On the Navigation menu, click Compute Engine > VM instances.
	2. Click Create.
	3. Specify the following, and leave the remaining settings as their defaults:
		Property	Value (type value or select option as specified)
		Name	demoiam
		Region	us-central1
		Zone	us-centra1-c
		Series	N1
		Machine Type	f1-micro
		Boot disk	Debian GNU/Linux 10 (buster)
		Service account	read-bucket-objects
	4. Click Create.


Use the Service Account User
	1. For demoiam, click SSH to launch a terminal and connect.
	2. Run the following command:
		$ gcloud compute instances list

	Result (do not copy; this is example output):
		ERROR: (gcloud.compute.instances.list) Some requests did not succeed:
	 	- Required 'compute.zones.list' permission for 'projects/qwiklabs-gcp'
	What happened? Why?

	3. Copy the sample.txt file from the bucket you created earlier. Note that the trailing period is part of the command below. It means copy to "this location":
		$ gsutil cp gs://[YOUR_BUCKET_NAME]/sample.txt .
	Result (do not copy; this is example output):

		Copying gs://train-test-iam/sample.txt...
		/ [1 files][   28.0 B/   28.0 B]
		Operation completed over 1 objects/28.0 B.
	4. To rename the file you copied, run the following command:
		$ mv sample.txt sample2.txt
	5. To copy the renamed file back to the bucket, run the following command:
		$ gsutil cp sample2.txt gs://[YOUR_BUCKET_NAME]

	Result (do not copy; this is example output):
		AccessDeniedException: 403 Caller does not have storage.objects.create access to bucket train-test-iam.
