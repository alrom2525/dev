How do I adjust maximum file size for uploads?

Newer versions of PHP

I ran into this same problem with Drupal 8 and the solution was different for my version of PHP. For newer versions of PHP, editing the php.ini may not work (I'm using PHP7).

These steps worked for me:
1. Look at the output of phpinfo(), towards the top there is a section called 'Scan this dir for additional .ini'. PHP will automatically look in this folder and use all the files in it with a .ini extension.
2. Add a .ini file with any name, I used site-name.ini
3. Add the new rules (in my case) ..

upload_max_filesize = 256M
post_max_size = 256M
4. Restart the webserver and recheck phpinfo() to see if your changes took.
