Agregar bootstrap a Laravel
https://laravel.com/docs/6.x/frontend

1. The Bootstrap and Vue scaffolding provided by Laravel is located in the laravel/ui Composer package, which may be installed using Composer:

$ composer require laravel/ui --dev
$ npm install && npm run dev

2. Once the laravel/ui package has been installed, you may install the frontend scaffolding using the ui Artisan command:

// Generate basic scaffolding...
$ php artisan ui bootstrap
$ npm install && npm run dev



All of the JavaScript dependencies required by your application can be found in the package.json file in the project's root directory. 


This file is similar to a composer.json file except it specifies JavaScript dependencies instead of PHP dependencies.
