Multistep form Laravel

If javascript is not your thing, stick with traditional forms. Its perfectly possible to do it using backend processing only.

Form1 - > collect data and POST to server.
Validate form1 data and save the fields in an array in the user's session
redirect to form 2
Form2 - > collect data and POST to server.
Validate form2 data and save the fields in an array in the user's session
redirect to form 3
Form3 - > collect data and POST to server.
Validate form3 data.
Save from session, step1 data, step2 data and step3 from the current request
Tricky if the user needs to press back on any page. You need to look in session and see if you already have in session form data from that step. You can then pass this to the view to repopulate the form with earlier data.
