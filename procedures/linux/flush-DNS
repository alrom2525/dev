Most modern Linux distributions such as Ubuntu 18.04 are using systemd resolved service to cache DNS entries.

To find out whether the service is running use the following command:

sudo systemctl is-active systemd-resolved.service

To clear the Systemd Resolved DNS cache, type:
	$ sudo systemd-resolve --flush-caches

	$sudo system-resolve - -statistics
